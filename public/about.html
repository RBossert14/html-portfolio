<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a 23 year old Computer Science graduate from Rowan University and I currently live in Sicklerville, NJ. I love everything about
  sports from watching, playing, and collecting sports memorabilia. I am passionate about learning more to further myself and my career
  in the software engineering and web development field.
